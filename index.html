							FCDR is an endeavour to promote mediation as a dispute resolution mechanism, with the vision of empowering parties to take on the responsibility of resolving their disputes. We believe that a substantial number and variety of cases can be settled by parties, through discussions in understanding why the dispute arose, conveying and listening to each other’s perspectives to the disagreement and looking at convergence of interests where the dispute can be resolved. Workplace disputes, family and matrimonial disputes, shareholder disputes, employment disputes, association disputes, etc. are all amenable to resolution through mediation.

                                Mediation/conciliation is a dispute resolution process in which a trained neutral third party, called the mediator/conciliator, assists the parties to a dispute to resolve their disputes through a facilitated negotiation. The negotiations are private and confidential. The mediator/conciliator helps the disputants to understand, evaluate options for resolving the dispute between them.

                                Any dispute can be resolved through mediation/conciliation. Disputes arising out of any relationship, contractual or otherwise can be resolved through mediation/conciliation. These will include commercial, employment, matrimonial, family, custody, maintenance and alimony, partition, business, real estate, consumer disputes, etc.

                                Once both parties agree to resolve their dispute through mediation/conciliation, the time and venue for the meeting is fixed. Mediation/conciliation starts with a joint session where the mediator/conciliator explains the process and the ground rules to all the parties. The Mediator/conciliator then listens to what the parties have to say about their respective positions. After listening to both parties, the Mediator/conciliator works with the parties to understand and identify their underlying issues, concerns and expectations.  <br> <br> This may be done in the joint session itself or in private sessions with each of the parties. The Mediator/conciliator continues to work with the parties to generate as many options as possible to address their issues and concerns and to resolve the dispute. Once the parties are able to reach a meeting point, the Mediator/conciliator in a joint session formulates the terms of the agreement in discussion with the parties and their lawyers. The agreement is then recorded and passed as an award. <br> <br> The mediator/conciliator controls the process and assists parties to determine the outcome by having joint and separate sessions with the parties as deemed necessary. Parties get clarity about the issues, disclose concerns and voice their inner fears in separate sessions and understand the perception of the other party in joint sessions. They then consider and evaluate options and come to a solution which is reduced to an agreement once they are sure about their choice.

                                No. Unlike arbitration, where there should be an agreement in writing between both parties to arbitrate and where only parties to such arbitration agreement can invoke the arbitration, in mediation/conciliation there is no necessity of such a written agreement. It is enough if one party suggests mediation/conciliation and the other agrees. This form of agreement is sufficient for a valid mediation/conciliation to take place.

If the other party/parties agree to the mediation/conciliation, then FCDR will nominate one of their panel mediator/conciliators to mediate the dispute. If the other party/parties refuse or do not reply, it will be deemed to be refusal on their part and in such a case, the mediation/conciliation cannot take place and you have to opt for the usual methods to resolve the dispute like litigation.

                                An arbitral award is the decision taken by the arbitrator after hearing both sides and evaluating their evidence.

A mediation/conciliation agreement is a consensual agreement and since the terms for the settlement agreement originates from the parties it is workable and is less likely to be challenged.
