							FCDR is an endeavour to promote mediation as a dispute resolution mechanism, with the vision of empowering parties to take on the responsibility of resolving their disputes. We believe that a substantial number and variety of cases can be settled by parties, through discussions in understanding why the dispute arose, conveying and listening to each other’s perspectives to the disagreement and looking at convergence of interests where the dispute can be resolved. Workplace disputes, family and matrimonial disputes, shareholder disputes, employment disputes, association disputes, etc. are all amenable to resolution through mediation.

3.2
Upon receipt of such a request and the registration fee in accordance with the Schedule of Fees of the FCDR, FCDR will contact the other party (ies) involved in the dispute and seek their consent to the submission of the disputes to Mediation/Conciliation.

3.3
The registration fee shall not be refundable. <br><br>
